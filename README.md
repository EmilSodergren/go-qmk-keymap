# keymap formatting for .c qmk files

This utility can format a ``keymap.c`` file and particularly the keymap array with LAYOUT's.
Adding your supported keyboard in the configuration file makes sure this utility can work with
any keyboard layout.

You can add ``// keymapviz: _BASE`` comments at the place you want the utility to output a
ASCII diagram of the indicated layer.
